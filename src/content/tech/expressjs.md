> What is Expressjs?

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools and features that simplify the process of building web applications
with Node.js.

> My experiece with it

My experience with expressjs involves:

1. Declaring routes and route handlers 
2. Creating complex middleware functions
3. Typescript integration for dev development
4. Using the [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) library for writing a functional style code and minimizing side effects
5. Creating http clients with openapi code generation tools ( specifically: [OpenAPI TS](https://openapi-ts.pages.dev/))
