> What is SpringBoot?

SpringBoot is a framework that simplifies the development of Spring-based applications. It provides a quick and easy way to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications. It automates many of the configuration tasks that are typically required when using Spring, such as setting up dependencies, configuring servers, and managing data sources. This allows developers to focus more on writing business logic and less on infrastructure. 

> My experiece with it

My experience with springboot involves:

1. Declaraing controllers and services for handling http requests and bussiness logic
2. Integrating third party components
3. Using the functional aspect of java for minimizing side effects
4. Database migrations with flyway
5. Incorporating robust exception handling and data validation
