> What are ReactJs and NextJs?

React JS and Next.js are both JavaScript frameworks used for building user interfaces.
React JS is a library/framework(depending on who you ask) that focuses on creating reusable components, making it efficient for building complex applications. It uses JSX as the templating format making possible to infuse js, html and css together. Its unopinionated by design meaning it offers flexibility by not imposing strict guidelines on project structure or architecture. This approach comes with benefits and drawbacks. While React is great for building Single Page Applications, there are cases where a more server oriented approach is needed. In that case NextJs is the tool for that. Next.js is a full-featured framework built on top of React. It provides additional features like server-side rendering (SSR), automatic code splitting, and routing, making it easier to create optimized web applications. SSR improves initial page load times and SEO, while code splitting reduces bundle size and improves performance.
